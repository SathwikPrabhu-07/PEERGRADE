PeerGrade 🚀

Learn by teaching. Prove by grading.

PeerGrade is a full-stack skill credibility platform where users don’t just claim skills — they prove them.
The platform enables peer-to-peer learning, structured assessments, and credibility scoring to build trustworthy skill profiles for students and professionals.

Learners lack a way to prove what they truly know
